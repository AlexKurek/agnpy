Emission Regions
================

At the moment the only emission region available in the code is a simple spherical plasmoid, 
commonly referred to as **blob** in the literature.
For more details on the electrons spectra you can read the :ref:`spectra` API.

Follows a snippet initialising the `Blob` (using `astropy` quantities) and 
visualising the distribution of electrons accelerated in it:


The :class:`~agnpy.emission_regions.Blob` can be printed at any moment
