agnpy docs
=================================

Description
-----------
`agnpy` focuses on the numerical computation of the photon spectra produced by leptonic radiative processes in jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).    
The numerical operations are delegated to `numpy arrays <https://numpy.org>`_, all the physical quantities computed are casted as `astropy Quantities <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/>`_.
